# Gabriel's Weather Dashboard

I created a weather dashboard for my dad for Father's Day. He is obsessed with knowing the weather, so this is now a place where he can go that is just for him to find out the weather in different cities so he can tell his friends. He's from Ireland, so I styled the app with the colours of the Irish flag.

## API Used

[OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## User Story

```
AS A weather-obsessed dad
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can tell my friends what the weather will be
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
```

The following image demonstrates the application functionality and its responsive for 2 devices (mobile still a challenge):
